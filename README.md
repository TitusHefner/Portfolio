# Data Science and Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of Python projects focused on data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project included highlights different aspects of data analysis, from data cleaning and exploration to analysis and visualization. Feel free to explore my projects ad learn about my skills in working with data. Each of the included projects are real projects that I have completed in my time working in data analysis in a manufacturing engineering context.

## Projects

### 1. Mechanical Signal Outlier Replacement

- **Description:** Performed analysis on sensor that was experiencing noise by filtering outliers.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.
- **Key Features:** Processed noisy data, filtered out sensor errors to allow for accurate analysis, created graphs to visualize how the filter works.

### 2. Change Point Detection Using Sensor Data

- **Description:** Analyzed sensor data from a machine to segment data based on where the algorithm suspects a machine adjustment occurred.
- **Technologies:** Pandas, Ruptures, Matplotlib.
- **Key Features:** Data cleaning and manipulation, implemented machine learning model to detect machine adjustments, automated iterative analysis on the generated data segments.

### 2. Manufacturing Target Analysis

- **Description:** Analyzes machine capability and recommends parameter targets for user defined fields, given data on the features from the machine's product output (ex. spring diameter).
- **Technologies:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Seaborn.
- **Key Features:** Uses traditional Six-Sigma process capability analysis but with more flexibility to fit manufacturing demands, eliminates the need for expensive third-party analysis tools, gives clear visuals. 


## Getting Started

To explore any of the projects listed above, navigate to the respective project file within my portfolio repository, and follow the instructions on the project's README file. Each project's README contains detailed information on how to set up and run the project. Please note that results may not look like the provided screenshots of the respective projects, as the data used for those projects is sensitive and non-public.
